# Terraform AWS Provider

This repository contains Terraform code for provisioning resources on AWS using the official AWS provider.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It enables you to define and provision infrastructure declaratively, treating your infrastructure as code. With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure configuration in simple configuration files and version them using version control systems like Git.

## What is Terraform used for?

Terraform is used to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure across various cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, among others. With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure as code, providing several benefits:

- **Reproducibility:** Infrastructure configuration is codified and can be reused across environments, ensuring consistency.
- **Versioning:** Infrastructure code can be versioned and managed using version control systems like Git, allowing you to track changes over time.
- **Automation:** Terraform automates the provisioning and updating of infrastructure, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing errors.
- **Orchestration:** You can define dependencies and relationships between resources, enabling ordered and controlled deployment of infrastructure.
